## 👻 Context

You work at **Horrorland**, a spooky and thrilling theme park.

The Halloween season is near, but something is wrong:

* Visitors are unhappy
* VIPs may not be getting their money’s worth
* Ticket pricing feels off
* Fear levels may or may not influence ratings

You’ve been tasked with answering:

1. What are the top selling products?
2. How do daily wait times correlate with customer satisfaction scores?
3. What are our most expensive costs?
4. What are the most common types of incidents per haunted house?
5. And more

## ❄️ Getting Started with Snowflake

### Step 1: Create a Snowflake Trial Account

1. Go to [signup.snowflake.com](https://signup.snowflake.com/?trial=student)
2. Choose:

   * **Enterprise Edition**
   * **AWS** as the cloud provider
3. Set up a **username** and **password**
4. Save your **Account Identifier**

### How to find your Account Identifier:

1. Open the **Snowflake Web UI**
2. Click your **user avatar** (bottom-left)
3. Go to **Account > View Account Details**
<img src="./images/account_id_1.png" alt="Account Identifier" width="400"/>
4. Copy the `Account Identifier`, e.g.:
   `RVDLYID-LX74876`
<img src="./images/account_id_2.png" alt="Account Identifier" width="400"/>

---

### Step 2: Ingest Raw Data

We'll simulate data ingestion using SQL scripts.

1. In the Snowflake UI, click **Projects** > **Worksheets** > **+**
<img src="./images/ingest_1.png" alt="Account Identifier" width="400"/>

2. If prompted, use the role **ACCOUNTADMIN** and the warehouse **COMPUTE_WH**
<img src="./images/ingest_2.png" alt="Account Identifier" width="400"/>

3. Copy the contents of [snowflake_insert.txt](./snowflake_insert.txt)
4. Paste into the worksheet, select everything, and **run** it
<img src="./images/ingest_3.png" alt="Account Identifier" width="400"/>
This will create your raw tables.

## ⚙️ Setting Up dbt Fusion

We’ll use **dbt Fusion**, the new Rust-powered dbt engine. dbt Fusion is still in beta, so sometimes we might use dbt Core. If you use Windows, read below.

### ✅ Option 1 (Recommended - Only supported on MacOS/Linux): Install via VS Code Extension

Search for `dbtLabsInc.dbt` in the Extensions tab or use these links:

* [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt)
* [Cursor Marketplace](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=dbtLabsInc.dbt)

It installs dbt Fusion automatically.

It will ask you to register the extension within 14 days. You can register for free.

---

### 💻 Option 2: Install via CLI (Only supported on MacOS/Linux)

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://public.cdn.getdbt.com/fs/install/install.sh | sh -s -- --update
```
```bash
exec $SHELL
```

---

### 🐧 Option 3: WSL (Recommended for Windows)
> [!WARNING]
> Native dbt Fusion installation on Windows is not officially supported, so the work around is to install the dbt Fusion using WSL and VS Code.


##### 1. Installing WSL on Windows
First thing to install the dbt-Fusion on Windows, you need to install the WSL in your Windows, for this you can use the [Official Microsoft tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)


##### 2. Installing WSL Extensions on VS Code
After the WSL, Install two Extensions in VS Code: “WSL” and “Remote Explorer”, this is pretty straight foward, but if you have doubts, you can check the [Official VS Code Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)

<img src="./images/remote_explorer_wsl.png" alt="Remote Explorer" width="400"/>

After this two steps, we are able to install the dbt-Fusion

##### 3. Initialize the WSL on VS Code
Click on the “Open a Remote Window” button on the bottom left corner of VS Code (Blue icon)

<img src="./images/open_remote_window.png" alt="Open Remote Window" width="300"/>

##### 4. Connect to WSL on VS Code
Click on “Connect to WSL”, it will prompt you to install a version of Linux if you don't have one. You can choose any version, I'm using Ubuntu.

<img src="./images/connect_to_wsl.png" alt="Connect to WSL" width="600"/>

Wait till your WSL kicks up, then proceed to the next step.

<img src="./images/connecting_to_wsl.png" alt="Connecting to WSL" width="400"/>

Check if the WSL is running in the bottom left corner of VS Code

<img src="./images/check_wsl_connected.png" alt="Check WSL connected" width="300"/>

##### 5. Installing the dbt Extension on VS Code
Navigate to the Extensions menu on the left and search for “dbt”, it should be the first extension to appear and install it.

<img src="./images/install_dbt_extension.png" alt="Installing dbt Extension" width="700"/>

##### 6. Installing the dbt Fusion
And last but not least, installing the dbt fusion, you will need a terminal on VS Code and WSL activated for this step.
You can open one in Terminal > New Terminal

You just need to run the following command (copy and right click into the terminal):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://public.cdn.getdbt.com/fs/install/install.sh | sh -s -- --update
```

If you have any doubt, you can follow the instructions as you were installing dbt Fusion on Linux with this [Official dbt Tutorial](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/fusion/install-fusion)

<img src="./images/running_dbt_install_command.png" alt="Running dbt Fusion" width="600"/>


##### 7. Check the install of dbt Fusion
To test if it the installation worked, you need to kill the terminal, open a new one and type the command

```bash
dbtf --version
```

It should appear a message with the current version.


<img src="./images/testing_dbtf.png" alt="Testing dbt Fusion" width="400"/>


#### Note: you ALWAYS need to initialize the WSL before starting or working on a dbt Fusion project, otherwise it wont work.

---

### 🐍 Option 4:  Windows Fallback: Use dbt Core (Legacy CLI)

If you can’t install dbt Fusion on Windows, you can fall back to the classic dbt Core CLI:

##### 1. Create a virtual environment

**On Windows CMD or PowerShell:**

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

##### 2. Install dbt for Snowflake

```bash
pip install dbt-snowflake
```

##### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
dbt --version
```

## 🛠️ Project Setup

This repository contains the complete dbt project for the Horrorland workshop. The project has already been initialized and configured.

1. Make sure you have completed the setup from the main bootcamp repository (https://github.com/DataGym-io/2025-08-dbt-mini-bootcamp)
2. The project is already initialized, so you don't need to run `dbtf init`
3. Use the same `profiles.yml` from your previous setup
   - If it's in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` (Mac/Linux) or equivalent Windows location, you're good to go
   - If it was in the project folder, copy it to the `/horrorland` directory
